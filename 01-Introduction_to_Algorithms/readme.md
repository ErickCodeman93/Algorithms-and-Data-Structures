# Algorithm guidelines

- Clearly defined problem statement, input, and output.

- The steps in the algorithm need to be in very specific order.

- The steps also need to be distinct.

- The algorithm should produce a result.

- The algorithm should complete in a finitive amount of time.

Before we define our algorithms we start by defining our problem in the definition of that problem we have clearly defined input satisfying any preconditions and a clearly defined output and algorithm is deemed correct.

First is correct algorithm and after is efficient because we help us solve problems faster and delivery a better end user experience in a variety of fields.
